# ProjectManager
ProfectManager is a Single Page Application (SPA) that can be used to manage and organize teams. Users can create Projects and add team members to those projects. 
Project administrators have privileges over the project, being able to invite members, and create, assign, and delete tasks. 

Projects can have multiple tasks, with an assigned level of urgency. Each task can also be assigned a custom category defined in the project. Users can communicate
with each other by commenting on tasks. All the changes in the project and the tasks are displayed so that the flow of the project can be better tracked.

See the project report for more information
